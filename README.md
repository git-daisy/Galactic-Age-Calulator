## Description <a id="description"></a>
  I still have a bit of work to do on this application, but I am confident in what I have built so far and am feeling much more comfortable using webpack! I will soon be adding another function to offer the amount of years past the life expectancy on a planet the user has lived.


## Setup/Installation Requirements <a id="setup"></a>

* _Open the terminal on your local machine_
* _If [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Nope Package Manager (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/) are not installed on your local device, follow the instructions [here](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/intermediate-javascript/getting-started-with-javascript/installing-node-js)_

## Additional Setup/Installation Note for Windows Users <a id="windows"></a>

## Specifications <a id="specs"></a>

| Behavior | Input | Output |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| The program should calculate the age of a user on different planets | When it receives a user age, it calculates how old they are on Murcury, Venus, Mars and Jupiter | It should return their life expectancy on that planet and if they have lived past their life expectancy, how many years past that expectancy they lived. |

## Known Bugs <a id="bugs"></a>
* Project does not utilize and user interface, I may come back for this later!
* Not a bug, but the application has unfinished functionality. There needs to be a function to offer how much farther past their life expectancy they lived.
